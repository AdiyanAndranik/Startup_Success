# Startup_Success
Analysis of startup success or failure

## Overview
This repository contains data and analysis regarding the success or failure of startups. The dataset includes information on 472 startups and their founders, along with indicators of success or failure for each company.

## Dataset
- **data.csv**: Contains the main dataset with information on startups and founders.
- **dictionary.csv**: Provides descriptions for some of the features included in the dataset.
- **startup_without_missing_values.csv**: This dataset is a cleaned and preprocessed version of the original startup dataset (data.csv).
- **Driving_Factors_Success_or_Failure.csv**: This dataset contains the driving factors identified through the analysis that contribute to the success or failure of startups.

## Objective
The objective of this analysis is to identify and explain the driving factors behind startup success or failure. Through exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical modeling, and machine learning techniques, we aim to uncover insights that can help inform future startup strategies and decision-making processes.

## Analysis
The analysis consists of several steps:
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handling missing values, data formatting, and feature engineering.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizing and understanding the distribution of variables, identifying correlations, and exploring potential patterns.
3. Model Building: Developing predictive models using machine learning algorithms to classify startups as successful or failed based on selected features.
4. Interpretation: Analyzing model results to understand the key factors influencing startup success or failure.
5. Saving the model.
